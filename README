Sample OpenShift/Kubernetes application demonstrating various features

Some notes:

- To recreate project in OpenShift/Kubernetes, use the objects defined in the os_objects folder. In the secret object, you will need to specify your own base64 encoded openweathermap API key.
- The s2i-go s2i builder image at time of writing is not currently in Docker Hub. You can build it yourself from here: https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-go
